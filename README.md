# Mad-Library---CS106
It's about C++ functions, strings, reading files, and decomposing a large problem
"Mad Libs" are short stories which have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. In the non-computerized version of this game, one person asks a second person to fill in each of the placeholders without the second person knowing the overall story. For example, "Tell me a noun: _". Once all the placeholders are filled in, the second person is shown the resulting story, ofen with humorous results.
